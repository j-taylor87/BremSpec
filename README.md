Select an X-ray imaging modality, filter materials, and technique factors (kV, mA, s) to see how these affect the shape of the Bremsstrahlung X-ray spectrum.
The characteristic X-rays of the target material, median beam energy, and area under the Bremsstrahlung 

What is the Bremmstrahlung spectrum? Bremsstrahlung means "braking" and the spectrum is named so for the X-rays that are produced when electrons strike a target.
The incident, negatively charged electrons interact with the nuclei of the target, causing the electrons to decelerate or "brake". 
This loss in kinetic energy is converted into X-rays (conservation of energy), which are then used for imaging.
